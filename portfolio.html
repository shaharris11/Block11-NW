                    Veldora and Rimuru are sworn brothers and they treat each other as family.
                    While Veldora embarrasses Rimuru frequently such as during his initial meeting with the people of Tempest and in most interactions with Luminous, Rimuru still makes a point to refer to Veldora as his best friend. As seen in their interactions, Rimuru acts akin to that of a responsible older brother to Veldora and tries to keep his destructive (juvenile) tendencies under control.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Veldora is extremely grateful for becoming friends with Rimuru, not only as the first being to chat with in years, but Rimuru's desire to bring forms of entertainment to his world. Veldora tends to act more natural around Rimuru, since Rimuru views Veldora as his first true friend in the new world.

                        After leaving the cave, Rimuru encounters a village of Goblins under attack by a clan of Direwolves. Caught in the heat of the moment, Rimuru agrees to help the Goblins in their battle. That night, the Direwolves arrive to try to take over as the new rulers of the Jura Forest! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the Wolves arrive, they get caught in Rimuru's wire traps, while the goblins hit them with crude bows and arrows. The Direwolf Boss is undeterred and charges in, getting caught up in Rimuru's wire trap. Rimuru gives the Boss one chance to turn back and run, and when he refuses, Rimuru decapitates him using Water Blade. With the death of the enemy leader, Rimuru devours the former boss's corpse and takes on his form. In a new wolven form, Rimuru gives the surviving wolves the option of submission, retreating, or death. While it initially seems like the other wolves intend to keep fighting, they ultimately submit to Rimuru. The next morning, Rimuru, who realizes that they're now responsible for now not one but two groups of monsters, decides to take measures to make sure they get along.
